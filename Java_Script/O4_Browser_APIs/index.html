<h1>Browser APIs are some APIs which is plugged to the Browser externally to the Core of JS</h1>
<p>So there are several APIs like that</p>
<p>So here we want to wait some time and execute a process</p>
<p>For that we have Timers</p>

<h3>So here we have two types of timers in JS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Set Timeout - Wait and Run (Only Once)</li>
    <li>Set Interval - Wait and Run (Continuously)</li>
</ul>

<script>
    //So let's check it out.!
    //Timer is a concept that we can use to execute a process repeatedly or just once
    //over a time period

    //will wait 2000ms and then recursively call the process everytime it completes 2000ms
    let count=0;
    setInterval(function(){
        count+=1;
        console.log(count);
    },2000);

    // setInterval(function(){},2000);//repeatedly


    //wait 2000 ms and then will invoke the process only one time
    setTimeout(function(){
        console.log("Hello");
    },2000);
