    //how to create a variable in JS
    //Strong Type
    //String name="Malitha";
    //int age=100;
    //int age="100"; //error

    //if a data type is defined before or after a variable and
    //if the value can be assigned according the data type those
    //languages are known as strong type languages


    //So this is how to create a variable in JS
    var name='Kavindu'; // what is the data type here.?
    //variable (Declaration Type)
    //because there is no type defined while creating a variable
    //js is known as Loose Type language



    //Dynamic Typing
    var address="Galle";
    typeof address;//string

    address=100;//we can change it as we like
    typeof address;//number -it will change dynamically to a number type

    address=true;//we can change it as we like
    typeof address;//boolean -it will change dynamically to a boolean type
    //because of this reason js is known as a dynamic type language



    //Scope Issue with var
    var age=100; //global variable
    {
        console.log(age);// working
    }



    {
        //local scope
        var tp=1199;
    }
    console.log(tp);//normally should be an error
    //but in js no issue at all. you can access var variables outside the scope
    //var is not satisfying scopes


    //variable hoisting
    console.log(i);//we can use variables which can be later initialized,
    //This is not an error according to js
    //according to the js, it's feature called hoisting

    var i=100;//initialize

    //what are the qualities with var variables?
    //01. Loose Typing : Yes
    //02. Dynamic Typing : Yes
    //03. Not care about scope : Yes
    //04. Variable hoisting : Yes

    //Var issues
    //01.Can duplicate same variable name : Yes
    //02.Not care about scope : Yes

    //So because there are so many issues with var, then we have another options
    //variable to create variables in JS

    //LET (Declaration Type)
    //========================
    //let declaration type
    let myID="C001";
    typeof  myID;//string

    myID=true;//will dynamically change to boolean
    typeof myID;//boolean


    {
        let myState=true;
    }


    // console.log(myAddress); // error
    let myAddress="Galle";

    //let's try to duplicate let variables
    let myCar="BMW1";
    // let myCar="BMW2";//error

    //console.log(myState);//error (let satisfied the scope)

    //what are the qualities with let variables?
    //01. Loose Typing : True
    //02. Dynamic Typing : True
    //03. Not care about scope : No : Let variables think about the scope
    //04. Variable hoisting : No Not Supporting

    //Var issues over let
    //01.Can duplicate same variable name :No : cant duplicate
    //02.Not care about scope:  No : Let variables think about the scope


    // const (Declaration type)
    // console.log(myColors);//not support hosing with const
    const myColors='RED'; //read only values
    // const myColors='RED';//cannot duplicate same variable name with const

    //what are the qualities with const variables?
    //01. Loose Typing : True
    //02. Dynamic Typing : False
    //03. Not care about scope : No : Let variables think about the scope
    //04. Variable hoisting : No Not Supporting

    //Var issues over const
    //01.Can duplicate same variable name :No : cant duplicate
    //02.Not care about scope:  No : Let variables think about the scope



    //So, finally what about variable name.?
    //is it case_sensitive.?
    //how you can start variable names.?
    let a=100;
    let A=200;
    console.log(a); //yes, js is a case sensitive language
    console.log(A);

    //what type of characters that you can use for the first letter of the variable.?
    let $hello=100; //valid
    let a_z_hello=100; //a-z any characters are valid
    let _hello=100; //_ is also valid
    // let 1_hello=100; //not valid
