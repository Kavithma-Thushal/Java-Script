<h2>Why js is imported above the body closing syntax</h2>




<!--Internal Scripts-->
<script>
    alert("Hello");

    //we import or write javascript just before the closing tag
    //of body because js is used to manipulate the DOM.
    //So we have to called them after the DOM creation process
    //is finished.

    /*hello
    there
    how*/
</script>

<!--External Scripts-->
<script src="../assets/myScript.js"></script>
